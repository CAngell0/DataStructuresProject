In the hashItOut and setItUp methods, the iterator is used to go through the key/values of each data structure.
Specifically, the iterator for the HashMap really just iterates through the Map.Entry data types in the structure.
These contain the individual key and value pairs.

While the iterator for the Set treats it similar to an for each loop with an array.
