To make a 2D array you essentially need to make an "array of arrays". Like this:
Type[][] testArray = new Test[rowLen][colLen];

To loop over a 2D array, you need a nested for loop. The first loop goes over each row, and the second goes over each column.
The indices of each allow you to select and individual cell of the 2D array.

for (int row = 0; row < testArray.length; row++){
   for (int col = 0; col < testArray[0].length; col++){

   }
}

I like the way the ice particle worked in my SandLab project. The ice floats to the top and stays there.
if (row != 0 && grid[row - 1][col] == WATER){
   swapParticles(row, col, row - 1, col);
}
if (row != grid.length - 1 && grid[row + 1][col] == EMPTY){
   swapParticles(row, col, row + 1, col);
}
